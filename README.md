# Obsidian tools

> This uses `MetaEdit` `DataViewJS` and `CustomJS` plugins for scripting

I am sharing various tools and things I have created for my personal obsidian vault.

Currently there is no documentation, but as I work on the items, I shall fill in comments and create basic usage documentation, and where possible generalize the scripts as these are obviously developed for my structure.

My folder structure that might be relevant for scripts:

```
Vault/
+--- Personal/
     +--- Logs/
          +--- Daily Journal/
               +--- <year>
                    +--- <month (Jan)>
                         +--- <day (01 - Fri)>.md
```

Only the scripts operating on those might need to be adjusted
